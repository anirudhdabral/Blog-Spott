# Read this first about using BLOG SPOTT

## Blog data is stored in localstorage of browser

When you first run the application, no blogs are stored at first.
A guide will be displayed to help you in creating a blog.

## Login details (id & password) are hardcoded and are stored in src/login-details.js

You can add more users if you want or change the existing users.

## Do not refresh the browser after logging in

User is logged-in or not, is stored in redux store, so refreshing the browser will reset the redux store (not logged in).
If user is not logged in, every page will redirect to Login page and is only shown after user logs in successfully.

## Context API is used to display message in bottom-right of some pages

A message is shown about the maker of this web-app on bottom-right corner of home (if no blogs are present), add and edit page.

Context API data can be accessed by child components (AddBlog.js, EditBlog.js) and super child components (HomeCard.js), both of which are used in this web-app.
1. App.js -> AddBlog.js
2. App.js -> EditBlog.js
3. App.js -> Home.js -> HomeCard.js

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
